	abstract = {In machine learning problems, differences in prior class probabilities -- or class imbalances -- have been reported to hinder the performance of some standard classifiers, such as decision trees. This paper presents a systematic study aimed at answering three different questions. First, we attempt to understand the nature of the class imbalance problem by establishing a relationship between concept complexity, size of the training set and class imbalance level. Second, we discuss several basic re-sampling or cost-modifying methods previously proposed to deal with the class imbalance problem and compare their effectiveness. The results obtained by such methods on artificial domains are linked to results in real-world domains. Finally, we investigate the assumption that the class imbalance problem does not only affect decision tree systems but also affects other classification systems such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines.},

The research shows that a spatially autocorrelated mode choice model, not uncommon because of, in terms of transit characteristics homogeneous neighborhoods, systematically overestimates transit trips from suburban transit-unfriendly areas and underestimates transit trips in the transit-friendly city center. Adding a spatial lag term into the model specification avoids the bias, however, it also changes sampling approaches, requires higher quality household forecast data and complicates forecasting},

Researchers often find that one's choice of strictly proper scoring rule has minimal impact on one's conclusions, but this conclusion is typically drawn from a small set of popular rules. In the context of forecasting world events, we use a recently proposed family of proper scoring rules to study the properties of a wide variety of strictly proper rules. The results indicate that conclusions vary greatly across different scoring rules, so that one's choice of scoring rule should be informed by the forecasting domain. We then describe strategies for choosing a scoring rule that meets the needs of the forecast consumer, considering three unique families of proper scoring rules.},

When the dependent variable represents a rare event, the logistic regression model shows relevant drawbacks. In order to overcome these drawbacks we propose the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) regression model. In particular, in a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with binary dependent variable we suggest the quantile function of the GEV distribution as link function, so our attention is focused on the tail of the response curve for values close to one. The estimation procedure is the maximum likelihood method. This model accommodates skewness and it presents a generalization of GLMs with log-log link function. In credit risk analysis a pivotal topic is the default probability estimation. Since defaults are rare events, we apply the GEV regression to empirical data on Italian Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to model their default probabilities.},

	abstract = {We study rare events data, binary dependent variables with dozens to thousands of times fewer ones (events, such as wars, vetoes, cases of political activism, or epidemiological infections) than zeros ({\textquotedblleft}nonevents{\textquotedblright}). In many literatures, these variables have proven difficult to explain and predict, a problem that seems to have at least two sources. First, popular statistical procedures, such as logistic regression, can sharply underestimate the probability of rare events. We recommend corrections that outperform existing methods and change the estimates of absolute and relative risks by as much as some estimated effects reported in the literature. Second, commonly used data collection strategies are grossly inefficient for rare events data. The fear of collecting data with too few events has led to data collections with huge numbers of observations but relatively few, and poorly measured, explanatory variables, such as in international conflict data with more than a quarter-million dyads, only a few of which are at war. As it turns out, more efficient sampling designs exist for making valid inferences, such as sampling all available events (e.g., wars) and a tiny fraction of nonevents (peace). This enables scholars to save as much as 99\% of their (nonfixed) data collection costs or to collect much more meaningful explanatory variables. We provide methods that link these two results, enabling both types of corrections to work simultaneously, and software that implements the methods developed.},

	abstract = {With the continuous expansion of data availability in many large-scale, complex, and networked systems, such as surveillance, security, Internet, and finance, it becomes critical to advance the fundamental understanding of knowledge discovery and analysis from raw data to support decision-making processes. Although existing knowledge discovery and data engineering techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, the problem of learning from imbalanced data (the imbalanced learning problem) is a relatively new challenge that has attracted growing attention from both academia and industry. The imbalanced learning problem is concerned with the performance of learning algorithms in the presence of underrepresented data and severe class distribution skews. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced data sets, learning from such data requires new understandings, principles, algorithms, and tools to transform vast amounts of raw data efficiently into information and knowledge representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the development of research in learning from imbalanced data. Our focus is to provide a critical review of the nature of the problem, the state-of-the-art technologies, and the current assessment metrics used to evaluate learning performance under the imbalanced learning scenario. Furthermore, in order to stimulate future research in this field, we also highlight the major opportunities and challenges, as well as potential important research directions for learning from imbalanced data.},

	abstract = {Latent modal preferences, or modality styles, are defined as behavioral predispositions characterized by a certain travel mode or set of travel modes that an individual habitually uses. They are reflective of higher-level orientations, or lifestyles, that are hypothesized to influence all dimensions of an individual{\textquoteright}s travel and activity behavior. The objectives of this paper are to understand and quantify different modality styles, and to show how the modality styles construct can be operationalized within the context of traditional models of travel mode choice. We employ the six-week MOBIDRIVE travel diary and estimate behavioral mixture models in which the modality style provides a behavioral rationale to the way in which unobserved heterogeneity is specified in the travel model. Our analysis consists of two stages: First, we explore the presence and types of modality styles suggested by the data through the means of a descriptive analysis. Next, we develop a model that captures the influence of modality styles on two dimensions of an individual{\textquoteright}s travel behavior: travel mode choice for work tours and travel mode choice for non-work tours. The modality styles are specified as latent classes; heterogeneity across modality styles include both the modes considered (choice set) and the values of taste parameters. The modality style of an individual then influences all of his/her travel mode choice decisions for work and non-work tours. In addition, error components capture unobserved correlation across travel mode choice decisions made by the same individual. Results indicate the presence of habitual drivers who display a strong bias for using the automobile and multimodal individuals who exhibit variation in their modal preferences. Multimodal behavior is further distinguished by those who appear to be sensitive to travel times and those who appear to be insensitive. Estimation results further find that modality styles are strongly correlated with more long-term travel decisions and life-cycle characteristics.},

Typically, there exists significant difference between the observed number of "adopters" and "nonadopters," which is usually coded as binary response. A critical issue involved in modeling such binary response data is the appropriate choice of link functions in a regression model. In this paper we introduce a new flexible skewed link function for modeling binary response data based on the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. We show how the proposed GEV links provide more flexible and improved skewed link regression models than the existing skewed links, especially when dealing with imbalance between the observed number of 0's and 1's in a data. The flexibility of the proposed model is illustrated through simulated data sets and a billing data set of the electronic payments system adoption from a Fortune 100 company in 2005.},

This paper focuses on the effects of choice set composition in route choice modeling by designing an experimental analysis of actual route choice behavior of individuals driving habitually from home to work in an urban network. The numerical analysis concentrates on a qualitative perspective, by considering path sets built with different generation techniques, and a quantitative perspective, by accounting for path sets constructed with sample size reduction from each initial choice set. Comparison of prediction accuracy across different choice sets suggests that a recently developed branch and bound algorithm generates heterogeneous routes that allow for estimating models with better prediction abilities with respect to the outcomes of the drivers' actual choices. Further, comparison of route choice models across different choice set compositions indicates that nonnested structures, such as C-logit and path size logit, yield more robust parameter estimates.},

	abstract = {This paper quantifies the large and small-sample effects of link misspecification on binary regression analysis. The large-sample effects are determined by deriving the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the regression coefficients and event probabilities assuming an incorrect link is used. The MLEs are asymptotically normal under regularity conditions but have asymptotic bias and are inefficient. For the important case of a fitted logistic link, detailed assessment is made of the asymptotic mean and variance of the MLE of the regression coefficients and the predicted probability at a given covariate for several non-logistic true link functions. The finite sample effects are investigated in a simulation study for sample sizes 20, 50, 100, and 200. The bias and mean squared errors of the logistic link MLE of the regression coefficients and predicted probability (at a given covariate) are determined for the same set of true links included in the asymptotic study. The results show that skewness has a greater effect on the bias and mean squared error of logistic MLEs than tail weight. Assessment is made of the sample sizes for which the asymptotic results apply.},

	abstract = {Surrogate losses underlie numerous state-of-the-art binary classification algorithms, such as support vector machines and boosting. The impact of a surrogate loss on the statistical performance of an algorithm is well-understood in symmetric classification settings, where the misclassification costs are equal and the loss is a margin loss. In particular, classification-calibrated losses are known to imply desirable properties such as consistency. While numerous efforts have been made to extend surrogate loss-based algorithms to asymmetric settings, to deal with unequal misclassification costs or training data imbalance, considerably less attention has been paid to whether the modified loss is still calibrated in some sense. This article extends the theory of classification-calibrated losses to asymmetric problems. As in the symmetric case, it is shown that calibrated asymmetric surrogate losses give rise to excess risk bounds, which control the expected misclassification cost in terms of the excess surrogate risk. This theory is illustrated on the class of uneven margin losses, and the uneven hinge, squared error, exponential, and sigmoid losses are treated in detail.},

This paper focuses on the probability that a policyholder reports a claim, where the classical logit link does not provide a right model. This is so because databases related with automobile claims are often unbalanced, containing more non-claims than the presence of claims. In this work an asymmetric logit model, which takes into account the large number of non-claims in the portfolio, is considered. Both, logit and asymmetric logit models from a Bayesian point of view, are used to a sample that was collected from a major automobile insurance company in Spain in 2009, resulting in a dataset of 2,000 passenger vehicle. We establish the validity of the asymmetric model in front of the conventional logit link. The use of a garage, the age of the vehicle and the duration of the client's relation with the company are all shown to be significant explanatory variables by the logit model. The asymmetric model includes, in addition, the length of time the policyholder has held a driving licence and the type of use made of the vehicle. The asymmetric model provides a better fit to the data examined.},

One-parameter subclasses can be used to examine symmetric or asymmetric deviations from the logistic model. The delta algorithm is adapted to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. A review is made of other proposed generalizations. The standard linear logistic model is widely used for modeling the dependence of binary data on explanatory variables. Its success is due to its broad applicability, simplicity of form, and ease of interpretation. This model works well for many common applications; however, it assumes that the expected probability curve $\mu$($\eta$) is skew-symmetric about $\mu$ = {\textonehalf} and that the shape of $\mu$($\eta$) is the cumulative distribution function of the logistic distribution. Symmetric data with a shallower or steeper slope of ascent may not be fitted well by this model, nor is there any provision for treating the two tails of the estimated curve $\mu$($\eta$) asymmetrically or fitting different distributions for $\mu$($\eta$). This article introduces a class of models, indexed by one or two shape parameters, that encompasses a wider range of situations than the standard logistic model (although the standard model is included). The shape parameters have been specifically designed to modify the behavior of the curve in the extreme-probability regions where problems of lack of fit may occur, while allowing for asymmetric treatment of the two tails. Members of this family approximate the Gaussian, Laplace, and extreme minimum and maximum distributions up to the first four moments. The model can be collapsed to several simpler one-parameter symmetric and asymmetric formulations.},

In this article we propose a new skewed link model for analyzing binary response data with covariates.

Using a Bayesian approach, we first characterize the propriety of the posterior distributions using standard improper priors. We further propose informative priors using historical data from a similar previous study. We examine the proposed method through a large-scale simulation study and use data from a prostate cancer study to demonstrate the use of historical data in Bayesian model fitting and comparison of skewed link models.},

One aim of this study is to determine its intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. Nosocomial infection also increases the duration of hospital stay. We quantify, in relative terms, the increased duration of the hospital stay when a patient has the infection. Methods:  We propose the use of logistic regression models with an asymmetric link to estimate the probability of a patient suffering a nosocomial infection. We use Poisson-Gamma regression models as a multivariate technique to detect the factors that really influence the average hospital stay of infected and noninfected patients. For both models, frequentist and Bayesian estimations were carried out and compared. Results:  The models are applied to data from 1039 patients operated on in a Spanish hospital. Length of stay, the existance of a preoperative stay and obesity were found the main risk factors for a nosomial infection. The existence of a nosocomial infection multiplies the length of stay in the hospital by a factor of 2.87. Conclusion:  The results show that the asymmetric logit improves the predictive capacity of conventional logistic regressions},

Here we investigate the factors that influence co-occurrence of members of the genus Protea in the Cape Floristic Region of southwestern Africa, a global hot spot of biodiversity. Due to the binomial nature of our response, a critical issue is to choose appropriate link functions for the regression model. In this paper we propose a new family of flexible link functions for modeling binomial response data. By introducing a power parameter into the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) corresponding to a symmetric link function and its mirror reflection, greater flexibility in skewness can be achieved in both positive and negative directions. Through simulated data sets and analysis of the Protea co-occurrence data, we show that the proposed link function is quite flexible and performs better against link misspecification than standard link functions.},

	abstract = {Existing models of disaggregate decision-making assume that preferences, as indicated by taste parameters and choice sets, are characteristics of the decision-maker that are exogenous to the choice situation and stable over time. Though the assumption has allowed travel demand analysts to use these models to forecast changes in observable behavior in response to changes in the decision-making environment, the assumption has overlooked the influence of these changes on the preferences underlying observable behavior. As a consequence, the use of these models has been limited to forecasting horizons over which preferences can reasonably be assumed to be stable. We build on Latent Class Choice Models (LCCMs) to allow for preference endogeneity. Conventional LCCMs formulate class membership as some function of the decision-maker{\textquoteright}s characteristics, but they ignore the impact of alternative attributes, which usually enter the class-specific choice models, on class membership. In this paper we introduce LCCMs with feedback from the class-specific choice models to the class membership model through the construct of consumer surplus. Class membership is hypothesized to be a function not only of the characteristics of the decision-maker but also of the consumer surplus offered by each class, which in turn is a function of alternative attributes, taste parameters and choice sets. The framework is applied to a case study on travel mode choice behavior. A comparison between LCCMs with feedback and traditional models that do not allow for preference endogeneity finds that the former performs better in terms of fit and offers greater behavioral insights, and that the latter can lead to biased forecasts.},

Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering, and other applications.The authors focus on examining the way a response variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment, and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

This assumption is imposed by the estimation technique because both the logistic and normal density functions are symmetric about zero. Rather than let methodology dictate substantive assumptions, I propose an alternative distribution for the disturbances to the normal or logistic distribution. The resulting estimator developed here, scobit (or skewed-logit), is shown to be appropriate where individuals with any initial probability of choosing either of two alternatives are most sensitive to changes in independent variables. I then demonstrate that voters with initial probability of voting of less than .5 are most sensitive to changes in independent variables. And I examine whether individuals with low levels of education or high levels of education are most sensitive to changes in voting laws with respect to their probability of voting.},

Two parametric families of link functions are investigated: the Gosset link based on the Student t latent variable model with the degrees of freedom parameter controlling the tail behavior, and the Pregibon link based on the (generalized) Tukey $\lambda$ family, with two shape parameters controlling skewness and tail behavior. Both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods for estimation and inference are explored, compared and contrasted. In applications, like the propensity score matching problem discussed below, where it is critical to have accurate estimates of the conditional probabilities, we find that misspecification of the link function can create serious bias. Bayesian point estimation via MCMC performs quite competitively with MLE methods; however nominal coverage of Bayes credible regions is somewhat more problematic.},

Indeed, there exist many domains for which one class is represented by a large number of examples while the other is represented by only a few. The purpose of this paper is 1) to demonstrate experimentally that, at least in the case of connectionist systems, class imbalances hinder the performance of standard classifiers and 2) to compare the performance of several approaches previously proposed to deal with the problem.  1 Introduction  As the field of machine learning makes a rapid transition from the status of "academic discipline " to that of "applied science", a myriad of new issues, not previously considered by the machine learning community, is now coming into light. One such issue is the class imbalance problem. The class imbalance problem corresponds to domains for which one class is represented by a large n...},

	abstract = {Proper scoring rules are overall evaluation measures that reward accurate probabilities. Specific rules encountered in the literature and used in practice are invariably symmetric in the sense that the expected score for a perfectly-calibrated probability assessor (or model generating probabilities) is minimized at a probability of one-half. A family of asymmetric scoring rules that provide better measures of the degree of skill inherent in the probabilities and render scores that are more comparable in different situations is developed here. One member of this family, a quadratic asymmetric rule, is applied to evaluate an extensive set of precipitation probability forecasts from the U.S. National Weather Service. Connections to previous characterizations of proper scoring rules are investigated, and some relevant issues pertaining to the design of specific asymmetric rules for particular inferential and decision-making problems are discussed briefly.},

However in real data examples published so far only one parameter link families have found to improve the fit significantly.

An analysis based on computationally tractable Bayesian inference involving Monte Carlo sampling algorithms is presented extending earlier work of Czado (1992, 1993b).

The integration of the scobit model with the time allocation model is done by applying Lee{\textquoteright}s transformation. Especially, the scobit model is adopted to relax the assumption, made in the Logit or Probit model, that individuals having indifferent preferences over participation and non-participation are most sensitive to changes in explanatory variables. Using a large-scale time use data (66,839 persons) collected in Japan, the effectiveness of the proposed integrated model is empirically confirmed. It is revealed that the probabilities of participating in compulsory-contracted activities and discretionary activities with the highest sensitivity to changes in explanatory variables are 65 and 81\%, respectively. Variances of social childcare variables explain about half of the total variance of the time use for discretionary activities; however, for compulsory-contracted activities, social childcare variables explain only less than 1\% of the total variance of activity participation and less than 10\% of total variable of time allocation.},

The introductory chapter presents the background of discrete choice analysis and context of transportation demand forecasting. Subsequent chapters cover, among other topics, the theories of individual choice behavior, binary and multinomial choice models, aggregate forecasting techniques, estimation methods, tests used in the process of model development, sampling theory, the nested-logit model, and systems of models.

Elasticities of travel demand with respect to density, diversity, design, and regional accessibility are then derived from selected studies. These elasticity values may be useful in travel forecasting and sketch planning and have already been incorporated into one sketch planning tool, the Environmental Protection Agency's Smart Growth Index model. In weighing the evidence, what can be said, with a degree of certainty, about the effects of built environments on key transportation "outcome" variables: trip frequency, trip length, mode choice, and composite measures of travel demand, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT)? Trip frequencies have attracted considerable academic interest of late. They appear to be primarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics of travelers and secondarily a function of the built environment. Trip lengths have received relatively little attention, which may account for the various degrees of importance attributed to the built environment in recent studies. Trip lengths are primarily a function of the built environment and secondarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics. Mode choices have received the most intensive study over the decades. Mode choices depend on both the built environment and socioeconomics (although they probably depend more on the latter). Studies of overall VMT or VHT find the built environment to be much more significant, a product of the differential trip lengths that factor into calculations of VMT and VHT.},

This is an important question both for comparing models and for assessing a final selected model. The traditional answer to this question is given by cross-validation. The cross-validation estimate of prediction error is nearly unbiased but can be highly variable. Here we discuss bootstrap estimates of prediction error, which can be thought of as smoothed versions of cross-validation. We show that a particular bootstrap method, the .632+ rule, substantially outperforms cross-validation in a catalog of 24 simulation experiments. Besides providing point estimates, we also consider estimating the variability of an error rate estimate. All of the results here are nonparametric and apply to any possible prediction rule; however, we study only classification problems with 0-1 loss in detail. Our simulations include "smooth" prediction rules like Fisher's linear discriminant function and unsmooth ones like nearest neighbors.},

	abstract = {Since the pioneering work of McFadden (1974), discrete choice random-utility models have become work horses in many areas in transportation analysis and economics. In these models, the random variables enter additively or multiplicatively and the noise distributions take a particular parametric form. We show that the same qualitative results, with closed-form choice probabilities, can be obtained for a wide class of distributions without such specifications. This class generalizes the statistically independent distributions where any two c.d.f.:s are powers of each others to a class that allows for statistical dependence, in a way analogous to how the independent distributions in the MNL models were generalized into the subclass of MEV distributions that generates the GEV choice models. We show that this generalization is sufficient, and under statistical independence also necessary, for the following invariance property: all conditional random variables, when conditioning upon a certain alternative having been chosen, are identically distributed. While some of these results have been published earlier, we place them in a general unified framework that allows us to extend several of the results and to provide proofs that are simpler, more direct and transparent. Well-known results are obtained as special cases, and we characterize the Gumbel, Fr{\'e}chet and Weibull distributions.},

This assumption is highly disputable in many cases in reality. In this paper, closed form expressions for the choice probabilities are derived for the case of independent Weibull distributed random costs. It is then necessary to assume that the variance of the Weibull distributed cost is a specific increasing function of its mean, which, however, may be a more natural assumption in many cases. The theoretical results are explained and exemplified in terms of the familiar stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) traffic assignment model.},

In general, the universe of RUM consistent models is much larger, even fixing some specification of V due to theoretical and practical considerations. In this paper, we explore an alternative RUM model where the summation of V and $\varepsilon$ is replaced by multiplication. This is consistent with the notion that choice makers may sometimes evaluate relative differences in V between alternatives rather than absolute differences. We develop some properties of this type of model and show that in several cases the change from an additive to a multiplicative formulation, maintaining a specification of V, may lead to a large improvement in fit, sometimes larger than that gained from introducing random coefficients in V.},

	abstract = {The multinomial logit model in discrete choice analysis is widely used in transport research. It has long been known that the Gumbel distribution forms the basis of the multinomial logit model. Although the Gumbel distribution is a good approximation in some applications such as route choice problems, it is chosen mainly for mathematical convenience. This can be restrictive in many other scenarios in practice. In this paper we show that the assumption of the Gumbel distribution can be substantially relaxed to include a large class of distributions that is stable with respect to the minimum operation. The distributions in the class allow heteroscedastic variances. We then seek a transformation that stabilizes the heteroscedastic variances. We show that this leads to a semi-parametric choice model which links the linear combination of travel-related attributes to the choice probabilities via an unknown sensitivity function. This sensitivity function reflects the degree of travelers{\textquoteright} sensitivity to the changes in the combined travel cost. The estimation of the semi-parametric choice model is also investigated and empirical studies are used to illustrate the developed method.},

They propose two machine-learning methods to estimate cognitively simple DOC rules. They observe consumers' consideration sets for global positioning systems for both calibration and validation data. They compare the proposed methods with both machine-learning and hierarchical Bayes methods, each based on five extant compensatory and noncompensatory rules. For the validation data, the cognitively simple DOC-based methods predict better than the ten benchmark methods on an information theoretic measure and on hit rates. The results are robust with respect to format by which consideration is measured, sample, and presentation of profiles.

	abstract = {Standard methods for estimating empirical models in economics and many other fields rely on strong assumptions about functional forms and the distributions of unobserved random variables. Often, it is assumed that functions of interest are linear or that unobserved random variables are normally distributed. Such assumptions simplify estimation and statistical inference but are rarely justified by economic theory or other a priori considerations. Inference based on convenient but incorrect assumptions about functional forms and distributions can be highly misleading. Nonparametric and semiparametric statistical methods provide a way to reduce the strength of the assumptions required for estimation and inference, thereby reducing the opportunities for obtaining misleading results. These methods are applicable to a wide variety of estimation problems in empirical economics and other fields, and they are being used in applied research with increasing frequency. The literature on nonparametric and semiparametric estimation is large and highly technical. This book presents the main ideas underlying a variety of nonparametric and semiparametric methods. It is accessible to graduate students and applied researchers who are familiar with econometric and statistical theory at the level taught in graduate-level courses in leading universities. The book emphasizes ideas instead of technical details and provides as intuitive an exposition as possible. Empirical examples illustrate the methods that are presented. This book updates and greatly expands the author{\textquoteright}s previous book on semiparametric methods in econometrics. Nearly half of the material is new.},

The novel point of our approach is that, while the model is theoretically derived by applying a generalized extreme value distribution to the random component of utility, the model maintains its closed-form expression. Also, the weibit model, where the random utility is assumed to follow the Weibull distribution, is a special case of the proposed model. This is achieved by utilizing q-generalization method developed in Tsallis statistics. Then, the generalized logit model is incorporated into a transportation network equilibrium model. The network equilibrium model with the generalized logit route choice is formulated as an optimization problem under uncongested networks. The objective function includes Tsallis entropy, which is a type of generalized entropy. The generalization of the Gumbel and Weibull distributions, logit and weibit models, and network equilibrium model is made within a unified framework with q-analysis or Tsallis statistics.},

The bivariate ordered probit models estimated in this study suggest that few built environment factors lead to the substitution of motorized mode use by nonmotorized mode use. Instead, factors such as increased bikeway density and street network connectivity have the potential to promote more nonmotorized travel to supplement individuals' existing motorized trips. Meanwhile, the heterogeneity found in individuals' responsiveness to built environment factors indicates that built environment improvements need to be sensitive to local residents' characteristics.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

He compares its accuracy and efficiency with MultiNest, concluding that it outperforms MultiNest in several cases. This comparison is completely unfair since the proposed method can not perform the complete Bayesian data analysis including posterior exploration and evidence evaluation on its own while MultiNest allows one to perform Bayesian data analysis end to end.

	abstract = {We study firms that sell multiple substitutable products and customers whose purchase behavior follows a nested logit model, of which the multinomial logit model is a special case. Customers make purchasing decisions sequentially under the nested logit model: they first select a nest of products and subsequently purchase one within the selected nest. We consider the multiproduct pricing problem under the general nested logit model with product-differentiated price sensitivities and arbitrary nest coefficients. We show that the adjusted markup, defined as price minus cost minus the reciprocal of price sensitivity, is constant for all the products within a nest at optimality. This reduces the problem's dimension to a single variable per nest. We also show that the adjusted nest-level markup is nest invariant for all the nests, which further reduces the problem to maximizing a single-variable unimodal function under mild conditions. We also use this result to simplify the oligopolistic multiproduct price competition and characterize the Nash equilibrium. We also consider more general attraction functions that include the linear utility and the multiplicative competitive interaction models as special cases, and we show that similar techniques can be used to significantly simplify the corresponding pricing problems.},

The authors illustrate each of these aspects using data on personal-computer preferences. They find that two-thirds of the subjects in the sample use some kind of lexicographic rule. In contrast, only one in five subjects use a standard lexicographic rule. This suggests that lexicographic rules are more widely used by consumers than one might have thought in the absence of the lexicographic variants described in the paper.

In these cases, proper simulation of the choice set is crucial for correct simulation of the choice context.

In this regard, our paper has two main objectives. The first is to give a general contribution to choice set modelling by extending and applying the concept of dominance among alternatives to the framework of random utility theory. The main result is the definition of a methodology for the generation of new dominance attributes, which can be used in choice set modelling. The second aim is to make a specific contribution to destination choice modelling: dominance attributes are defined from the above methodology and introduced into this choice context, and new spatial variables reproducing better knowledge of zones with a privileged spatial position are also proposed. Methodology and attributes are tested both on synthetic and on real data.},

We add to this growing body of literature by proposing a model based on the idea of a {\textquotedblleft}satisficing{\textquotedblright} decision maker. In contrast to previous models (including recent models implementing alternative choice rules), satisficing depends on the order in which alternatives are evaluated. We therefore conduct a visual conjoint experiment to collect search and choice data. We model search and product evaluation jointly and allow for interdependence between them. The choice rule incorporates a conjunctive rule for the evaluations and, contrary to most previous models, does not rely on compensatory trade-offs at all. The results strongly support the proposed model. For instance, we find that search is indeed influenced by product evaluations. More importantly, the model results strongly support the satisficing stopping rule. Finally, we perform a holdout prediction task and find that the proposed model outperforms a standard multinomial logit model.},

First, they relax the requirement that an acceptable alternative must be satisfactory on one criterion (disjunctive) or on all criteria (conjunctive). Second, they relax the assumption that consumers make deterministic judgments when evaluating alternatives. They combine the two generalizations into a probabilistic subset-conjunctive rule, which allows consumers to use any number or subset of decision criteria when screening alternatives and permits them to be uncertain about the acceptability of attribute levels. These two features allow for a screening process that is uncertain and more flexible than the deterministic conjunctive and disjunctive rules currently described in the literature. The authors describe a latent-class method for the estimation of the subset-conjunctive rules and the attribute-level consideration probabilities using either consideration or choice data. Applications using both types of data suggest that the proposed models predict as well as linear models do; can make different predictions of consideration, choice, and market shares; and provide insights into consumer decision processes that are different from those obtained with linear models.},

Behavioral and economic models of choice processes are difficult to estimate when using stated and revealed preferences because the underlying process is latent. This paper introduces Bayesian methods for estimating two behavioral models that eliminate alternatives using specific attribute levels. The elimination by aspects theory postulates a sequential elimination of alternatives by attribute levels until a single one, the chosen alternative, remains. In the economic screening rule model, respondents screen out alternatives with certain attribute levels and then choose from the remaining alternatives, using a compensatory function of all the attributes. The economic screening rule model gives an economic justification as to why certain attributes are used to screen alternatives. A commercial conjoint study is used to illustrate the methods and assess their performance. In this data set, the economic screening rule model outperforms the EBA and other standard choice models and provides comparable results to an equivalent conjunctive screening rule model.},

* To address this difficulty, we propose an asymmetric logistic regression model that uses a new parameter to account for data complexity. We observe that this parameter controls the model's asymmetry and is important for adjusting the weights associated with observed data in order to improve model fitting. This model includes the ordinary logistic regression model as a special case. It is easily implemented using a slight modification of glm or glmer in statistical software R.


* Simulation studies suggest that our new approach outperforms a traditional approach in terms of both predictive accuracy and variable selection. In a case study involving fisheries data, we found that the annual catch amount had a greater impact on stock status prediction, and improved predictive capability was supported with a smaller AIC compared to a generalized linear model.


* In summary, our method can enhance the applicability of a generalized linear model to various ecological problems using a slight modification, and significantly improves model fitting and model selection.},

Two major advantages are offered by the generalized t-links. First, a symmetric generalized t-link with an unknown shape parameter is much more identifiable than a Student t-link with unknown degrees of freedom and a known scale parameter. Secondly, skewed generalized t-links with both unknown shape and scale parameters provide much more flexible and improved skewed link regression models than the existing skewed links.

Attribute cutoffs are incorporated into the decision problem formulation; it is then argued on extant empirical evidence that individuals may view these constraints as {\textquotedblleft}soft{\textquotedblright}. This leads to the formulation of a penalized utility function that allows for constraint violation, but at a cost to the overall evaluation of the good. The proposed model is able to represent fully compensatory, conjunctive and disjunctive choice strategies, as well as combinations thereof. The properties of the proposed theoretical model are examined and discussed. From the theoretical framework, statistical models of choice behavior are easily derived; in their simplest forms, these models can be estimated using existing software.

Denominated the Parametrized Logit Captivity (PLC) model, it is a generalization of the well-known {\textquotedblleft}dogit{\textquotedblright} specification. The PLC model is shown to be theoretically and empirically more flexible than the latter. Work mode choice data collected in a 1977 O/D survey in S{\~a}o Paulo, Brazil, is used to obtain parameter estimates, as well as to evaluate consumer reaction to a series of perturbations in travel time, travel cost and income, for both the PLC and Multinomial Logit models. Comparisons between the two specifications are made in terms of statistical fit, reasonableness of predictions and differences in predictions across models.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a variant of random utility choice models based on mixed probability density functions, hence the adopted moniker {\textquotedblleft}k-Mix models.{\textquotedblright} Mixed pdf{\textquoteright}s contain components with the usual continuous density function specifications that underlie common choice models (e.g. MNL, GEV, MNP), but also contain one or more discrete probability mass points. These mixed pdf{\textquoteright}s result in models that can be interpreted to reflect different regimes of decision-making. Two exemplars developed in this paper, the 2- and 3-Mix models, are the result of a mixed pdf that combines a continuous pdf, plus one or two mass points, respectively. The 2-Mix permits a specific alternative to be in the Tradeoff Condition (the usual situation for alternatives in extant choice models, and the only regime in which compensatory utility is defined and compared) or in the Rejection Condition (in which an alternative has extreme disutility). The 3-Mix model adds the Dominance Condition (in which an alternative has an extremely attractive utility) {\textendash} interestingly, the inclusion of this condition makes the model capable of simulating a particular form of satisficing decision making. These models are derived, discussed and compared relative to several extant choice models, then applied empirically on both a RP data set (work trip mode choice) and a SP data set (recreation campsite selection).},

	abstract = {Random utility models have been widely employed in environmental valuation. But stochastic choice set formation models in the random utility framework are rarely applied in this literature, although previous research has shown that ignoring choice set formation (when it exists) leads to biased parameter estimates and welfare measures. This paper conducts Monte Carlo (MC) experiments to investigate the directionality and magnitude of welfare measure bias arising from ignoring or misspecifying choice set formation. We find that when attribute cutoff-based choice set formation exists in the data generation process, typical RUM models ignoring or misspecifying choice set formation underestimate welfare measures by 30{\textendash}50\%. Models that approximate choice set formation may produce unbiased welfare measures, but constitute a promising area for future research. This paper illustrates the importance of applying choice set formation in environmental valuation and provides practical guidance about the usage of stochastic choice set formation models.},
